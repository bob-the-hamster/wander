=Notes from Bird=

- When the Ramthara wants to light up a wood blockage in the forest, she walks to a tile, where the other characters are standing. So they overlap. Maybe it would be nicer, if she would make her fire from a free place?
- At the beginning of the forest, you can't see, where you are exactly standing, because the trees are above you. I would make them transparent, so that the way to go is clear.
The monters are very well designed. But I would like to see them less often, because there are too many random battles. 


=Sounds=
** Every dang attack (don't have to be unique!)
** Plip squee
** Friar Cart Wheels
** Rock Owl hoot and wings
** Tetra knight grow arms

=LATER=
* Maybe the ELF card could be part of a fetch quest for (?)
* Dying in a Plip Tamer battle should not be a game-over
* Item-collection mini-game similar to "Small Medals"
